  <h2>What is 30MFF?</h2>
  <p>
    30-Minute Film Festival, or 30MFF, is an event where we are given 30 minutes to come up with a simple film with a
    theme. The challenge comes with trying to devise a video in such a short amount of time. You need to brainstorm and
    idea and theme, while also having the time to shoot your film and make any editing if needed. It's a great way to
    learn to bond with your team and have a creative solution to a challenge.
