  <p>Welcome to the 30-Minute Film Festival page! Here, you can find our project about the experiences of NYUAD students
    over the years. Watch to see how we at NYUAD get to grow, and our feelings going through college in such a unique
    place. College is a place where young adults mature greatly and prepare for the real world, and NYUAD is no
    exception in that matter. </p>
  <p>Head over to the 30MFF tab to see our video. You can also go to About to see more info about what 30MFF is.</p>
