# Assignment 1 - 30-Minute Film Festival (30MFF)

# Description
Our film is a simple one, which intends to show the development of NYUAD students as they progress though their college career. As the video progresses, you will see the 
experiences of a freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior. You can see how they've grown and matured as people over the years and how they feel about being in college.

# Process
The process for my website was pretty simple. I made the basic form of the website, starting with the video page, and then built the rest from there. The hardest parts were 
designing all the CSS parts. I never knew how difficult it would be just to have a box that is centered on a page. Making the CSS, I built each part in the order that the div 
classes appear on page, so I started with the title, and ended with the main text and the body. Creating the navigation buttons were not too difficult, except for the light/dark 
mode change. At first the button was not clickable for some reason when I used <button>, so I had to use <a> instead, which worked out alright. The big issue was that I originally 
had the script in a separate js file, but I think for some reason button clicking cant execute code from another file, so I had to write the script in the html instead. I 
thought adding the comments system under the video would be a lot more difficult than it really was, since I basically had to just copy-paste a script in that allowed it to 
function. I felt like this was kind of cheating for my js function, since I didn't write it, which is why I also opted to add the light/dark mode as well.

# Reflection
I think overall the website looked basically how I wanted it: simplistic but modern-looking, be easy to use, and of course, have dark mode. I think I may have wanted to add a bit 
more text to the page but I wanted to keep things concise so the user is more likely to read it through. Having long-winded info-dense paragraphs means its more likely to be 
skimmed over (or in my experience anyway). Maybe in the future I would want to change the color scheme a little bit, and make it a bit more appealing to look at than just shades 
of gray.
